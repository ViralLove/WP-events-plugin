== Description ==

EventifyMy — a very special plugin dedicated for small events and classes. Perfectly works for yoga studios, any kind of creative classes, small concerts, music jams, children activities etc.
Our plugin allows you to very easily enter your events details through our user friendly backend. Events are displayed throug a very clean, modern and at the same time structured design. You can customize any color to match any website style, works even for a dark theme. The font can also be the same as on your website (if you miss one, just contact us and we will add it to the list).
Our booking solution suits well for events with multiple sessions. You may fully customize the emails sent to the buyers and events managers separately. You can collect contact information and comments through the signup form. Later we will additionally provide a custom forms builder.
You can display either a full list of events or specific events. You can also embed a single event view or directly a signup form.
Our plugin works with localization plugins. You can have your events described in multiple languages matching the needs of your website.
